        description: `React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
            - Just the UI: Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about t
            he rest of your technology stack, its easy to try it out on a small feature in a
            n existing project. - Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation 
            for ultra-high performance. It can also render on the server using Node.js â€” no 
            heavy browser DOM required. - Data flow: React implements one-way reactive data 
            flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional da
            ta binding.`,
